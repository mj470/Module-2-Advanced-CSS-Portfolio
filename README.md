# Module-2-HW
Advanced CSS Professional Portfolio Project
# Description 
This project was to use advanced CSS elements to create the framework for an interactive professional portiolfio. The idea was to make links and sections that will in futrue feature examples of my development work that can be used as a reference for future employers. This was accomplised by creating a detailed HTML file that deignated containers and functions of each section. The CSS file was then connected and featured specific classes to section out the page and make it useable.

# Installation

# Usage
This site will be used as a reference point to add future work to my professsional portfolio. As I learn more design elements I will add them to create a more functional space. This should have several different working links to future projects I complete. This site will also function as a way to contact me for furutre jobs.
